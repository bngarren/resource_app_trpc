Refactoring:
  ☐ Create an internal/app Error type to be thrown within service layer. @est(1 day)
  Need to be able to throw some customized errors within the app logic. All errors should be caught at the route level and handled,
  then thrown to the client as TRPCError? Versus a custom ?ApiToClientError that extends TRPCError with some meta about whether retry should be attempted...
  ☐ Refactor transactions to return a Promise rather than the awaited result. @est(15 minutes)
  This will pass the error handling to the caller of the function and not have to check for null.
  See `prisma_createHarvestOperationsTransaction()` for example
  Fix: prisma_updateHarvestOperationsTransaction, prisma_updateSpawnedResourcesForSpawnRegionTransaction
