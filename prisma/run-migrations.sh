##### Summary #####
# This script allows us to tack-on additional SQL to the auto-generated migration file that Prisma makes.
# For instance, to add Postgresql triggers, we can store that SQL in a separate file and it will be
# added anytime we are making a first-time/initial migration.
#
# 1. Runs `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only` to generate a new migration file based on the
# current schema. But does not run the actual sql queries yet.
# * If this is the first/initial migration:
# 2. For each file path in SQL_FILES_TO_APPEND, will append this SQL code to the end of the
# new migration.sql
# 3. Finally, run `npx prisma migrate dev` to actually run the migration.sql and update the database
#
# * If this script is run when a previous migration exists, it will still generate a new migration,
# * which may or may not be empty, dependening if there was any schema change. The appended SQL files
# * should only be in the first/initial migration!
#
